          <p>Before I started my first full-time job as an auditor, I was nervous and wanted to know how I could better prepare myself for my new job. I cold emailed several professionals who worked at the company I would join, asking them what skills I should brush up on before starting my new job. The most common advice I got back was to learn Excel, but this only scratched the surface of what I needed to know for the job. Now, after working as an auditor for about a year, I have learned what the most important skills are for newbies in this field. Usually, candidates receive their job offers weeks or even months before their start date. So, what should you do during this period to better prepare yourself for your new role? Below are some skills that you can learn before joining an auditing company:
          </p>
 
 
    <h6>1. Outlook</h6>
 
    <p>Most companies use Microsoft Outlook email, so it’s important to learn how to use Outlook before joining your new company. I still remember how lost I was the first time I was asked to check my colleagues’ calendars and schedule an appointment. Also, it’s always a good idea to learn how to organize emails in Outlook. Some additional tricks won’t hurt too, like how to delay emails for 1 to 2 minutes after clicking “send” so you can double check any spelling errors in your email before it’s too late.</p>
    
    <h6>2. Microsoft Excel</h6>
    <p>If you work as an auditor, Excel is one of the most common tools you will use on a daily basis. Functions like VLookup, HLookup, PivotTable, Index Match, Absolute Reference, Formatting, Group Data, and Compare Differences are must-knows. Besides, if you master some short cuts, it will make you more productive at your job. I would highly recommend the “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/excelisfun">ExcelIsFun</a>” YouTube channel for practical Excel lessons that are particularly geared toward the accounting field. 
      </p>


<h6>3. Microsoft Word</h6>

<p>While working as an auditor, you deal with numbers most of the time. There will be times when you need to write memos or complete tasks using Word. I was taught in my job that I always need to do “Track Changes” when I work on a Word document, so that it is easy for others to see what I changed in a collaborative setting. Learning certain functions like Numbering, Formatting, Add Footnote, Insert Object, etc. will also be useful.</p>


<h6>4. Project Management</h6>

<p>At your job, you most likely will be assigned with multiple tasks and have to follow up with different people. Keeping things organized and on track is a very important skill. I personally use different colored sticky notes to list all of my tasks for the week. Each color corresponds to one of the following categories: tasks that I need to complete, tasks that are under progress, and tasks that are already completed. It’s better to have a clean desktop background so your sticky notes are more prominent and therefore serve as better reminders. Another tip is to make use of your Outlook Calendar.</p>


<h6>5. Accounting or Auditing 101</h6>

<p>Knowing accounting or auditing 101 will help you understand the big picture of what you are doing. Sometimes, you may not receive training right away. It may happen later, as training is usually conducted in batches. You don’t have to be an expert, but knowing the foundation can help you connect the dots and understand your job better. You will also likely have help along the way, as your colleagues will often guide you through specific tasks.
</p>


<h6>6. Research Skills</h6>

<p>When you work on a memo or workpaper, you may need to research the applicable guidance in your company’s internal library or outside databases. The internal library is especially helpful, as you can find templates for different workpapers. Additionally, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Edgar</a>, an online database of SEC, is a great search tool for companies filings and disclosures.
</p>

<h6>7. Develop Your Strengths</h6>

<p>It’s important to have additional skills that are not directly related to the auditing domain. For example, it’s not required to be a good notetaker to be a good auditor, but if you take really good notes or meeting minutes, you will be an indispensable part of the team. With that said, have some skills that you can proudly claim as your specialty. That way, people will think of you right away when they need help in that particular area.
</p>

<p>Above are the skills, from my perspective, that you should work on after receiving an offer to become a first-year auditor. It doesn’t require a long time to develop these skills, but mastering these skills can make you stand out as a first-year auditor and leave a great impression on your new colleagues.</p>
